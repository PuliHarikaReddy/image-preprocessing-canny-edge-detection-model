# image-preprocessing-canny-edge-detection-model

A Canny edge detector is a multi-step algorithm to detect the edges for any input image. The code follows below steps to detect potential edges in an image.

1. Gaussian Blur
2. Finding Gradient Intensity
3. Calculating Gradients Horizontally and Vertically
4. Thinning the Edges
5. Finding Potential Edges
6. Final Detection
